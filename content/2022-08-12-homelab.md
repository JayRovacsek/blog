At home I inflict a fair bit of tech on my family. This all started from inspiration from a 
friend many years ago and continued to manifest while I was being sucked down a tech rabbit-hole
at uni and then into my professional career.

This endeavour has been great in helping me understand tech that I otherwise wouldn't have dug further 
into:
* managing a router beyond your basic plug and play devices offered by ISPs
* managing firewalls to segment networks logically rather than physically
* setting up storage servers to hoard data
* managing DNS both to block unwanted connections but also ensure egress traffic from the network is secure rather than default 
* containerisation
* security implications of tech choices
* etc

The iterations of home-lab have been pretty stock standard thus far; 

* Running all Windows compute and getting host to host connectivity going via shares 
* Jumping to [Unraid](https://unraid.net/) which simplified the management of storage on Linux initially as well as offering a nice graphical approach to docker which was on a very sharp upwards trend at the time (and still is).
* Trying the waters of solutions such as [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com), [vSphere](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/index.html) and more - these are good solutions but didn't tickle the part of my brain it needed to.
* Going (mostly) all in on [NixOS](https://nixos.org/)

The above greatly simplifies the journey in tech for my home-lab over the last close to decade now. 
But I'm just spewing thought into text in order to punch that `git commit` 
in before work.

It seems homelabs are somewhat destined to become forever-jobs unless you put bounds on what you 
want to do and the time you'll spend on it. This isn't bad unless you're time poor but
does mean you mightn't have the time to journey into some nooks and crannies of tech such as BSD 
jails vs docker vs chroot. This is fine because the time bounds play an important
part of deciding what to use and it'll generally be best to keep to well trodden paths. Why bother 
with jails if most of the industry is hailing docker/OCI as the reasonable path forward?

Without the `I use NixOS btw` meme settling in too much, for homelab purposes I think the composability 
of Nix is a huge win for time savings - you can still leverage common patterns 
made by others in a pinch but also build/design your own if you're inclined. There's some magic that 
exists in config-as-code that is certainly scratching that part of the brain I needed right now.

As my career has centered around the identification and rating of risks associated with various technical 
decisions or implementations the approach NixOS applies makes it far easier to reason with the system state
than other solutions. 

There is a dark-side to this choice however and it's been teased out in a fair few blog
posts by others recently and admitted by [Tweag](https://www.tweag.io) that the ability to simply pickup and 
run with the solution is [not your run-of-the-mill system](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-08-04-tweag-and-nix-future/)

There are possible fixes for this beyond the suggestions made in [the roadmap for nix by Tweag](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-08-04-tweag-and-nix-future/) as 
well as the idea to [shift the language / offer alternatives](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-03-11-nickel-first-release/) 
to give a newcomer a better chance at understanding the design quickly. Currently the documentation for Nix is _okay_
however more complex systems will require a good understanding of the language and mastery of the [repl](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix_command/repl) 
which isn't a good argument to use the solution if the environment is anything beyond a homelab.
Myself and a friend regularly laugh about a quote from Wesley Aptekar-Cassels in their blog post about this [The Curse of NixOS](https://blog.wesleyac.com/posts/the-curse-of-nixos):

> that requires configuration with the second-worst homegrown config programming language I've ever used

The above is _too true_ until a user has surmounted a learning curve that effectively mirrors that of:
* rust
* dwarf fortress
* eve-online (never played it, but have heard about as much plus the meme fits)

&nbsp;
{{ resize_image(path="../static/images/eve-online-learning-curve.png", width=500 height=500 op="fit") }}

What's worth noting is that a fair number of Nix users host their configurations in open repositories
to enable alternative parties to learn and leverage config use-cases and generally make life easier.
For example while the `dockutil` package exists for darwin_x86_64; the options behind the package would
assume a manual application of commands to get a config as desired. But by some quick searching on github or
a search engine I was able to find an example of options applied by [tboerger](https://github.com/tboerger)
which enabled me to utilise an [extremely similar setup](https://github.com/JayRovacsek/nix-config/blob/6645bc56bbcd29e1895516d893205655307aba15/options/dockutil/default.nix#L1)

The point still stands though that the language used here might be a barrier to new users; the example
uses some abstractions of `with lib;` and a few other things that a new user won't be able to understand relatively 
quickly and this makes me a :sadpanda:

There is a flip side to this also which is part of the barrier here is the implications of most
common learning pathways for people when it comes to programming: usually this goes;
* here's a language
* here's an if statement
* here's a loop
* here's an object

Arguably the application of teaching generally not encompassing or favouring non-functional
languages has meant that there's a significant asynchronousity of approachability when it comes to
functional languages (such as nix) 

Functional language advocacy certainly fits into the easy to assume non-pragmatic lens being applied to
proposed solutions but this is tainted by the above problem which is learning preferences for:

```js
  const original = [1,2,3]
  let result = []
  for (let index = 0; index < original.length; index++) {
     result.push(original[index] * 2)
  }
```

VS

```js
  const original = [1,2,3]
  const result = original.map((x) => x * 2)
```

The above both do the _same_ thing yet the first example will be the intro to programming under a rationale
that readability is increased - a fallacy driven by biases in the learning pathway the assessor takes also.

There's an irony here though as this is being written by a person with biases also ðŸ™‚

For now, chill with some Lonks, Zeldos and one-day the world might bend to our whims ðŸ˜…
