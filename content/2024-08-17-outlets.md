Today I put a minimal amount of effort into revisiting my efforts to write thoughts down. Maybe this
whole space should be a journal or non-public affair; but to date in this repo I've been solely focused on
technology: and intend to continue in that way.

With the last few years of generative AI causing an explosion of content that is of dubious value; I still see
anything I put here as a self reflection piece as well as a healthy outlet for brain dump rather than not.

It's been almost 2 years since I put anything in here, I'd love to jot more down to evict it from grey-matter and
have a place of reference to continue enabling a fossil record of what arbitrary tech I might have cared about over
time.

# Flake'd

One of the coolest elements of coming back to this content recently, has been a reflection of how I'd structured this
repository: without the use of [flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes)!

Now that I've resolve that; this repo applies a lot of opinions about checks that should be applied as part of the
deployment process; they've certainly become some of my favoured mechanisms to ensure code, style, format etc consistency.
The tldr of this is the checks block in the flake (at time of writing):

```nix
{
  checks = {
    git-hooks = self.inputs.git-hooks.lib.${system}.run {
      src = self;
      hooks = {
        actionlint.enable = true;

        deadnix = {
          enable = true;
          settings.edit = true;
        };

        nixfmt = {
          enable = true;
          package = pkgs.nixfmt-rfc-style;
          settings.width = 80;
        };

        prettier.enable = true;

        typos = {
          enable = true;
          settings = {
            binary = false;
            ignored-words = [ ];
            locale = "en-au";
          };
        };

        statix-write = {
          enable = true;
          name = "Statix Write";
          entry = "${pkgs.statix}/bin/statix fix";
          language = "system";
          pass_filenames = false;
        };

        trufflehog-verified = {
          enable = pkgs.stdenv.isLinux;
          name = "Trufflehog Search";
          entry = "${pkgs.trufflehog}/bin/trufflehog git file://. --since-commit HEAD --only-verified --fail --no-update";
          language = "system";
          pass_filenames = false;
        };
      };
    };
  };
}
```

In essence, ensuring suitability of everything from the github actions, nix code format and utilisation (auto-remove dead code),
markdown formatting, checks for typos and more! All generally running within Github Actions within ~1 minute.
